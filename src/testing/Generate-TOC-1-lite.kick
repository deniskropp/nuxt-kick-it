We were so far into our allotted time, and I'd hardly started my essay. But I just couldn't think about the damned essay with Professor Buchanon sitting just a few feet away from me.\nHis stripes shown through his button-up shirt. He nudged his glasses up on his snout. Memories of our last time together flooded my mind. In the middle of my daydream, however, he looked up from his work and shot me a menacing glare, creating a pinch of heat inside me.\nMy eyes widened and darted back down to my paper. My heart was pounding. I got back to writing. I knew it was too late now to finish my essay, so I bided my time to ask him that sweet question once again.\nSure enough, the alarm on his desk rang before I could even finish the first page. \"Pencils down.\" My classmates stood to turn in their essays.\nI held my paper up to my chest, hiding it from my classmate's prying eyes, and took my sweet time to step up to his desk. He pretended not to pay attention to me until I'd arrived.\n\"Um... Professor Buchanon.\" He looked up to me and removed his glasses.\n\"Yes, Miss Lily?\" His tone was so cold. It sent a shiver down my spine.\nI couldn't help but smirk a bit as I laid my essay in front of him. \"Well you see, Professor, I just couldn't finish my essay in time. Is there anything I could do to make it up? Anything at all?\" I rested my hands on his desk, flouncing my cleavage a foot his face.\nHe glanced at my tits, then back up to my face with nary a single hint of expression. I saw the way his eyes lingered though, and it got me so hot.\nHe let out a long sigh, and stood up, setting his pen down. My heart skipped a beat. I could see the outline between his legs. My mouth watered. \"Anything, huh, Miss Lily? What am I going to do with you?\" He said simply as he shut the door to the classroom.\n\"Anything you want, Mark.\" I couldn't wait any longer. I began to unbutton my shirt. He was closing the blinds, but glanced at me a few times as he did.\n\"Oh, you naughty kitty,\" he scolded. \"That's Professor Buchanon.\" He loosened his tie as he approached me. The thick fur of his chest escaped his collar. I gulped as we finally touched.\nHe picked me up and set me down on his desk. He continued unbuttoning my shirt as his teeth grazed my neck in a kiss. The electricity between us was palpable.\nI worked my way down his buttons myself, and felt his hard-cut abs on my way down to his belt, which I snaked out of its loops.\nBefore I could toss it to the side, he took it from my hands, and slithered it around my neck. My tail twitched and my breath hitched. \"There we are. A collar for my naughty kitten.\"\n\"Profess- or- Buchanon,\" I choked out. He flipped me onto my stomach and lifted my skirt.\n\"That's right, my little slut,\" he whispered, tugging on the belt. He unzipped his pants. \"Say my name, you naughty kitten.\"\n\"Professor-\" I gasped when he released the tightness on my neck for a second. \"Buchanon-\"\nHe slapped my ass. I whimpered, but began to purr. I looked over my shoulder at his devious smirk. My eyes fell upon his cock, thick, long, and ready. I wanted him to make my insides ache. But he made me wait.\nHe spit on his paw and rubbed me through my panties. \"Why, my little kitten, you're already soaking wet.\" His low purr sounded more like a growl. He tore my panties off with his a single claw.\nI felt the air on my exposed skin and bit my lip. I longed for his cock so bad. He snaked two fingers inside. I gasped, but he only pulled the belt tighter around my neck.\nHe curled his fingers and began to slide them in and out of me rhythmically. I leaned into the collar he'd placed on me. My vision began to darken, stars dotting the room. My pussy felt like pure bliss. He loosened his grip on my leash again and I gasped a breath in.\nBlood rushing to my head pushed me to the edge of climax. \"Oh, Mark,\" I moaned, grinding into his hand. As I felt it approach, however, he slipped his fingers back out.\n\"Easy, now, not yet, kitten. And you aren't to call me Mark,\" he scolded me. I pouted. He maneuvered me with ease back off of the desk, and ordered me to kneel. I was shocked at how much more rough he was being than last time.\n\"I said kneel.\" He grabbed a fistful of my hair and lowered me to the ground. I let him, but stared up at him, confused and scared. It felt shameful that this was the most turned on I'd been in my life. \"Open.\" I opened my mouth wide, turning my attention to his huge cock.\nWith one push, he shoved himself down my throat. I gagged and flinched, but he held my collar with one hand and my hair with the other. Tears were in my eyes.\n\"That's right, baby, take it all in,\" he groaned, shoving himself further slowly. I couldn't believe there was still more. I placed my hands on his thighs and tried to push away, but he held me steadfast. \"Now, kitten, behave.\" He yanked on my collar, and I stopped resisting. Tears were streaming down my face now. He pleasured himself with my mouth, moaning as he did so. Just as I felt as if I were on the verge of blacking out, he came in my mouth.\n\"Swallow,\" he commanded. And I did.\nHe pulled his cock from my mouth and let go of me and my leash. I fell onto my side on the cold tile floor, coughing and gasping for breath. He towered over me. The harsh fluorescent lights shone off his fur. He looked statuesque: a god. And I wanted nothing more than for him to ravish me with all he had.\nHe swooped me up again and leaned me against his desk, facing away from him. Here it comes, I thought, suspense pulsing through me.\nHe lifted my skirt again. One of his strong paws took my leash in hand once again, while the other stroked his cock a few times. He tapped me, toyed with my clit, and rubbed my entrance with his cock.\nThen, all at once, he slammed himself into me with a yank on my leash. I let out a pained moan, which caused a strong tiger paw to cover my mouth before I could give us away.\n\"You be good now, kitten,\" he warned, perfectly still inside me. I nodded, tears in my eyes. His girth was pushing my limits. It seemed to fill every inch of me. Then came the thrusting.\nWhat started as pain dulled as his body moved in time- in, out, in, out. Forceful yet precise, he violated me. The collar tightened. Stars filled my tear-clouded vision, and the world disappeared into sheer ecstasy. In, out, in out.\nHe pounded me, shaking the desk. He smacked my ass and I emitted the faintest whimper. Everything hurt, but everything felt like the best thing I'd ever had. He snaked an arm around my waist and played with my breast, leaning in and breathing hot on my neck. I shivered.\nHe picked up the pace, and I could feel it coming. The rhythm of his powerful cock was bringing me closer and closer to bliss. \"Mr. -Buchanon-,\" I choked out. \"I'm gonna cum.\"\n\"Me too,\" he breathed out.\nWait, what?\nIt was too late. Mr. Buchanon let out a low moan. My pussy felt even hotter and wetter than it had been moments before. He pulled out slowly. I yelped in pain just before I myself was brought to orgasm. Shockwaves ripped through my pussy, sheer bliss, sheer happiness. My body felt warm.\nHe rubbed my clit until my pussy stopped twitching. My face was pressed against his desk, my tongue hanging out, until the orgasm passed.\nI snapped back to reality. \"Professor,\" I stood, shocked at his disregard for what I'd told him last time we'd been together. \"You have to buy me the morning after pill.\"\n\"Miss Lily,\" he addressed me with a calm, unforgiving callousness. \"I'm afraid,\" he yanked me closer to him, holding me against his bare body, \"that you promised me anything.\""}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Writing Prompt: Explore the forbidden desires between a student and her strict professor as they engage in a steamy encounter after class.
