If I still didn't want to drown I'd have to get away from the water. If the tide came in while I was unconscious it would kill me.\nWhen I saw grass through my blurry vision I decided I'd gone far enough and let myself float into darkness despite my fear of dying.\n\n'Goddammit!' I groaned as I swatted at insects buzzing around my ears.\nI grumbled while I blinked against the bright light, then tried to sit up after a while. My wet clothes added to my irritation and I pulled them off, choosing the bother of taking them off against keeping them on.\nAfter a few struggles I tossed the last piece aside and laid back naked on the warm sand. I cared less about being covered with that than the wet cloth clinging to me.\nI recalled the main events that led me up to here; born into a poor family which sold me into the military because they wouldn't be able to feed and raise me otherwise, the subsequent training which showed I had a tenacity for keeping alive, and the assignment to one of the most abused secret sections of the military after almost killing a senior officer who came close to raping a girl at a bar.\n'GODDAMMIT, FUCK YOU!' I screamed. 'WHY DON'T YOU ALL GO TO HELL!?'\nWe were supposed to set up a hidden base at the latest M class planet that was found. Its inclusion in one of the territories had been a fight between the feline Silth and humans for years, each claiming they found it first and that the simple civilizations living on it were part of their combined worlds. The universal council had been trying to establish a peaceful settlement between our species but with the continual tensions and skirmishes between us it was almost impossible. So far there was only the official promise to not colonise the planet and come into contact with the species on it while the dispute continued.\n'As if.' I said to myself and tossed a nearby rock away from me.\nThe encounter with the Silth carrier was devastating. With both ships running stealth close to the sea surface, we were in stone throwing distance when we found each other. The panic reaction was to unleash our full arsenals upon one another. The few fighter pods from both sides who managed to launch, including mine, had just about obliterated each other when the carriers burned down and sank into the ocean.\nWith no home to return to and most of my equipment damaged I headed off to the nearest island available on the local map. The pod broke down before I was able to reach it and I used up all my stamina to reach it by swimming.\nI stood up, shaking on my legs. I would have to hold out long enough for help to arrive. If that ever came.\nThat was the risk of a classified unit. Nobody would acknowledge you, nobody would save you, nobody would praise you. Only the pay and the thrill were worth it.\nI reviewed my surroundings, white beach, tropical climate, mostly blue sky, vacation paradise for most people.\nI hated it. I saw unknown predators and diseases, difficulty in finding a decent shelter, food.\n'DAMMIT!' I shouted again.\nI took another look at my clothing. The only useful thing that came with it was the knife. No matter how advanced technology became, the one thing that stayed part of basic equipment was the knife. I didn't care about my clothing, but I was aware enough to not take chances and buried all of it in the sand.\nAfter that I faced the jungle in front of me. Just me and my knife. I wasn't ready, but I had to survive.\n\nI was lucky in the way luck favoured tropical zones on earth, there was food available. I sampled anything resembling food and soon enough found out what was edible and what had to be avoided. A shelter I could make from branches and big leaves. Within several days I had created a basic means of survival.\nI took my time, waiting at the nearby source of fresh water to observe what kind of wildlife came there. I could, but didn't particularly like to survive on plants and small fish alone. A species of rodent reminding me of rats and mice was abundant and wasn't a bad source of protein. A larger species looking a little more like deer and a species like pigs lived around here as well. Too bad I'd need something like a bow for those. I also encountered a medium sized predator with brown, grey and black streaked fur, something that had a canine head, the body of a feline and a short, bushy tail. It had acted aggressively, but a growl and a stomp from my foot had sent it away.\nIt had been nine days since I found myself washed up on the beach. In the meantime I had secured myself a small shelter and sources of nutrition. A semblance of daily routine had establish itself by gathering food, fishing and exploring the area. I needed to get into contact with military command, but that was of secondary concern. I still needed to survive as if I'd be the last of the human race.\nGradually I began to expand my exploration of the area and knowledge of the routine of wildlife around here. I had salvaged my clothes from the beach, putting them aside and only using my pants while hunting. It made running a little less awkward. Digging into the memories left from survival training I found the right materials to make a bow and arrows. I even thought about looking into salvaging steel from my pod, see if I could melt it and create more effective arrow tips and maybe a blade or two.\nI couldn't get a clear view from the edge of the beach, but it looked like the island was the tip of a short underwater mountain ridge, maybe even volcanic in origin although I saw no direct evidence from the hilltops I was able to see. I expected it would take me several days to walk across the island, not counting the extra time it would take to get through the jungle. At least that would mean there'd be enough wildlife to survive without having an impact on the place. Can't live if I ate all the food here.\nSeeing it would be a long time before military control knew the ship went missing, and even more time before they'd have any idea where to look, I decided I'd go explore the island in a while and accept it as my new home because the chance of getting rescued would be minimal.\n\nA jungle, or any kind of area involving lots of trees, was never quiet and it took some time before I was able to get used to the noises from the nocturnal animals and get some decent sleep. This time though I woke up when something screamed and yowled nearby.\nI grabbed my knife and stoked up the dying fire to make a torch. If this was a new kind of predator prowling at night I'd like to know it first before it could attack me thinking I'd be a sleeping meal for it.\nI heard several more yelps and growls and suspected it was one of those mixed predators which I named cags. Yeah, I'm no biologist. I carefully followed the sound of scuffling behind some bushes to find one in a death grip with a poisonous lizard. The cag twisted its muzzle and the lizard went limp, letting go of the cag's leg. The cag limped with its bleeding leg toward a small shaking heap of fur. It let out a peep and I understood the mother cag had protected her young. I saw her lick it and it crawled closer to her. She didn't call for others so it looked like this was her only young.\nThe bushes rustled as I moved out of them and she growled at me. Her head swayed a little from the poison's effect.\n'Shh..' I said softly, putting down my bow and torch beside me. 'I'm not here to harm you.'\nI sat on my knees until her growls faded, then crawled slowly closer. The little one whined softly, giving its mother licks and nudged her with its nose, but she would no longer be able to respond to her child. I crawled closer and it looked at me, panic in its yellow eyes, then pawed at its mother.\n'I'm sorry, little one.' I whispered as I sat in front of them. 'She can no longer care for you.'\nIt whined for a while, licking its mother's face again, then laid down on the ground against her, glancing at me. I didn't know if it was going to be a stupid idea, but thinking I'd have to let nature take its course and abandon the pup, or kitten, or whatever the right name was didn't sit well with me.\nI held out my hand. 'I can't teach you anything of your kind, but I can make you my pet.' I said. 'How about that?'\nIt cocked its head and blinked at me.\n'Staying here doesn't look like a good idea to me.'\nIt sniffed in my direction, then crawled a bit forward on its belly.\n'I don't think you'd taste good, so no worry about me eating you.'\nIt crawled up to the tip of my fingers and sniffed them.\n'I'm a new smell, but at least I'm not a deadly predator.' I said smiling gently, then thought about that. 'Well, not in the sense that you'd find here otherwise.'\nIt moved a step closer and I could stroke its muzzle with one finger until it seemed convinced I wasn't something bad to it, then it moved close enough for me to scratch its head and behind its ears.\n'See? Nothing to worry about.' I whispered.\nAfter a while of scratching I leaned forward and started digging. Luckily the ground was soft here and it didn't take too long to make it deep enough to bury the little one's mother. I lowered the body gently down, then picked up the little one and held it so it could lick its mother's muzzle one last time in farewell. It whined while I covered the grave and picked it up to take it with me to my shelter.\n'Your new home.' I said, putting it down before closing the entrance.\nIt sniffed and looked around, then back at me.\n'I guess I'll also have to name you.' I said, then looked closer to see it was a she. 'Rover or Boris won't do, I see.' After trying a few names I chose Wendy.\n'One of my fallen comrades had a little sister named Wendy and used to tell me about her all the time. He was the one who took care of her since they lost their parents in her teens. He sounded more like her father to me than a brother.'\nI chuckled at the memory and picked up Wendy to stroke her fluffy fur and distract me from the sudden sadness. She yipped at me and made me laugh.\nA couple of leaves made up her bed in a hollow in the ground next to my head. 'Sleep now, and we'll start a new chapter in our lives tomorrow.'\nShe yawned and closed her eyes just before I drifted off to sleep.\n\nHaving to take care of Wendy meant my plans to explore the island further had to be postponed for a while. Luckily she grew up fast and I was able to teach her how to hunt with me. When we found prey she would sneak up around them and chase them my way where I could shoot it with my bow or skewer it on the short spear I had made.\nFirst time we stood triumphantly over our dead deer.., thing, I felt like a Neanderthal hunter. To think I flew a fighter pod and handled sub machine guns not too long ago. I kind of miss the compact power tool for killing.\nEventually it became time to go and I packed the few things I'd need in a backpack I had made from the hides of our kills.\n'Ready, girl?' I asked Wendy.\nShe looked up at me and barked. Cags don't bark as low as dogs, but at a higher pitch which fits more with the feline side of her species.\n'All right then.' I said and headed for the nearest hilltop and the hopefully first good look at the whole island.\n\nAs I expected, the jungle slowed down our progress and it took us two days to reach the hill top. The sun was halfway down the horizon and it became time to find a place to camp for the night. I spotted a clear patch in the tree cover and headed that way.\nWhat I saw surprised me. There was a stone floor here. Overgrown partially, but in good shape without grass or anything growing through cracks. I bend down and felt the surface. Smooth, but not so much like it had been made with a precision machine. The material looked like it was made by processing the ground found around here. From a distance it wouldn't look like there was a separate flat surface here.\n'I think we'll stay here for the night, girl.' I said to Wendy and unpacked the backpack to make a fire.\nWendy assumed her role of guardian and inspected the floor area. After getting a fire going I started roasting the three rodents we bagged during the day and gathered big leaves to serve as bed and plates for our meal.\nDuring the meal I wondered if I'd find more proof of an ancient civilisation on this island. Maybe I'd get lucky and find weapons or other items I could use.\nIt was almost dark when we had finished eating and I propped up my backpack to serve as a pillow and Wendy crawled up to me. I wrapped my arm around her and she gave me a soft lick on my mouth, making me chuckle and give her a goodnight kiss back. Between the warm climate and her warm and soft body I needed no blanket to sleep comfortable at night.\n'Good night, sweet Wendy.' I whispered and listened to the sounds around us for a while before sleep took over.\n\nThe next morning I checked the area around the floor but found no more evidence of whoever build it. I did get a better view of the island and saw it had a slight bend to it and there were three main tops to the ridge formed by the hills. With any luck I'd find more at one or both of the other tops.\nThe trek to the middle took two more days which were pretty uneventful, apart from encountering Wendy's kind twice. The first time I wondered what she would do when four cags threatened to attack us, and was pleasantly surprised to see her take my side and chase them away with more voracity than I could have imagined from her size. The second time I noticed she did make sure I was behind her before she snarled and lashed out at a group of three cags. She could be brave, but I did have to be close.\n'Good girl.' I said each time, scratching her behind her ears and down her back, which made her body and tail shiver.\n\nI was pondering about setting camp for the night or try to reach the top when I heard Wendy bark a warning. I walked up to her and saw she had found a crevice hidden between the trees and bushes, deep and wide enough to not come back up once you fall down there.\n'Careful, girl.' I said, peering into it, then step back before the urge to jump in started.\n'It would be safer to set up camp.' I told her and she agreed with a bark.\nI spotted a small clearing in the tree cover and headed that way. I just stepped into the clearing when the Silth appeared. I heard the double tap from a gun while I ducked sideways. The first bullet missed me. The second hit my shoulder.\nI avoided hitting my shoulder when I fell and only had a split second to react to one of them jumping me. Twisting my body, I caught it with my feet and send it flying. A crack told me it had landed very badly on something. The second one came at me the moment I got on my feet and slashed me with its claws as I weaved and hit it aside. It recovered quickly and went for me again. Before it reached me Wendy jumped at it with a snarl. It stumbled, I grabbed it and swung it hard into a clump of trees. It rotated with a yelp of pain, then saw it go down the edge of the crevice.\n'OKAA!' I heard the first Silth yell and dive at the second's arm, who had grabbed onto a bush. Just as the first one grabbed the second's wrist, the bush uprooted and the second dangled into the crevice.\n'OKAA!' the first one yelled again and it had sent another chill down my spine, just like the first time I heard her yell that word.\nI had learned enough of their language to know the second one was the first's mother. The first one tried desperately to pull up its mother, but I saw the pain in its face and the way it squirmed. It must have broken a rib or two when I kicked her away. It wouldn't be able to save her on her own.\n'DAMMIT!' I shouted in my frustration and moved to the Silth. I laid down, reaching my good arm out to the mother. 'Grab on to me!'\nHer blue eyes met mine in stunned surprise.\n'I said grab on to me!'\nShe looked at her child who was in pain, then let go with one hand to grab my wrist. Pain shot through my wound as I pulled with all my strength.\nMy heart was still beating fast and I panted while I sat back against a tree and Wendy licked my face in concern. I let out a weak chuckle and stroked her head.\n'I'm all right, girl.' I whispered, happy to see how much she cared. 'I'm all right.'\nThe mother Silth spoke to its child, then looked back at me. I was in too much pain to wonder if they still wanted to kill me. She moved towards me and I wouldn't be surprised if she tried to finish the job. I would still fight, but I didn't show I was ready.\nShe sat down on her knees before me and she reminded me of a black panther I had seen in a video. The Silth had smaller muzzles and noses though, more like a house cat, as were their ears, only those were bigger in proportion. And their tails were like normal felines at the base, then grew thick and fluffy with a short point at the end. She wore the standard military green sleeveless jacket and cargo pants and her black fur was dusty from our fight.\n'Why you save me?' she asked.\nI knew their kind would have learned our language, just as we did for the advantage in war, but I was still surprised to actually hear one speak. She did have a slight lisp, which I suspected they'd all have when speaking. It would make communication easier, but I wouldn't reveal my knowledge of their language just yet.\n'Guilty conscience.' I grimaced.\nShe looked puzzled at me.\n'It's not something I'd like to talk about.'\nShe pondered for a moment, then nodded. She leaned forward but Wendy growled and she sat back.\n'Your wound..'\n'I'll live.' I said, not quite ready to have her touch me and gestured at her child. 'Go check on..?'\nShe glanced at her child. 'Naylee.' she said. 'My daughter.'\n'It looks like she has broken ribs. Make sure she doesn't have a punctured lung.'\nShe nodded at me. 'I'm Tashee.' she said and went back to her daughter.\nI sighed and watched a discussion between the two while Tashee checked Naylee. Naylee was angry, but Tashee scolded her and she kept quiet. Tashee pulled a small box out of one of her pockets and made her swallow a pill with some water. Then she came back to me.\n'Do you have bandage kit?'\n'Not really.' I said, then looked around for my backpack. 'Wendy, fetch?' I said, pointing at it and she dragged it back to me.\nTashee looked with interest at her. 'You trained it?'\n'Another story for another time.' I said and pulled out the rolls of cloth I had cut from my shirt.\nI checked my wound and was glad to see the bullet had went right through. I draped one of the rolls over my shoulder, then winced as I tried to grab the other side.\n'Let me.' Tashee said, reaching out for me.\nWendy growled again and Tashee sat back.\nI knew I didn't have much of a choice. 'It's okay girl, sit.' I said to Wendy with a scratch on her head and she sat down.\nTashee reached out carefully to me and bandaged my shoulder for me while Wendy kept an eye on her.\n'Thanks..' I said as Tashee sat back.\nShe shook her head. 'You save my life. I owe you.'\n'Just try not to kill me, okay? That's the only thing I ask for.' I said and pushed myself up from the tree. 'It's getting late and I need to set up camp.'\nShe looked up at the sky and nodded. 'Need to make camp too. Is it okay to join you?' she asked, looking up at me. 'I will help you change bandage later.'  \nI don't know if it was me, but I saw an innocent look in her eyes that asked me to give her a chance. 'I guess.' I said, trying not to sound too easily in giving in.\n'A moment.' she said and went back to help Naylee up.\nThey followed Wendy and me to the clearing I had seen earlier and found a large piece of fairly flat rock. I made up a bed for me and Wendy while Naylee used the same method to make a bed for her and Tashee while Tashee set up a fire in the middle of the rock.\nI untied the rodents Wendy and I had caught earlier from the backpack, laid them in front of me and sighed. With just one good arm it'll be a chore to roast them.\nTashee had seen my dilemma and moved closer. 'Let me?'\nShe gestured at the rodents they had caught and I felt amused at how much we were alike in our survival.\nI nodded gratefully. 'Please.'\nI admired the ease with which she gutted the rodents and prepared them for roasting. Maybe it was the way they were used to cooking. When the roast was done she offered small roots with it.\n'These are a little spicy.' she said and bit on one. 'Good with meat.'\nI nibbled on one and it was mildly spicy, enough to add taste to the rather plain taste of rodent meat. I nodded my thanks and shared my meal with Wendy.\nTashee and Naylee were talking low between the two, and I saw Naylee glancing at me a couple of times. She most have gotten the yellow eyes from her father.\nTashee moved closer to me again on her knees. 'May we know your name?'\nAh, I hadn't even thought about that. 'Rafe.' I said. 'I'm sorry, I totally forgot with all the things going on.'\nShe gave me a gentle smile. 'Is okay. We're sorry for all that happened.'\n'Same here. But I don't blame you, we're not quite on friendly terms right now.'\nShe looked a little puzzled.\n'I mean, our two species aren't friends.'\nHer face lit up in comprehension, then looked sad. 'True.'\nI didn't like to see her sad. It just felt wrong, even if I hardly knew them. 'Doesn't mean we can't be friendly.' I offered.\nShe smiled again and nodded. 'Please.'\nI smiled back. 'I can't be mad at someone who can roast so well.'\nShe chuckled and went back to Naylee, who glanced at me again with a look of disbelieve.\nTiredness caught up with me and I needed to sleep for recovery. 'I'm going to sleep.' I said. 'You have a good night.'\n'Sleep well.' Tashee said.\nWendy crawled up to me and her familiar warmth and smell relaxed me enough to fall asleep in moments.\n\nWe all awoke with a start when we heard a long roar. Naylee grabbed her gun while Tashee and I both grabbed our knives. Wendy bared her fangs but kept quiet while she sniffed the air. The fire was burning enough to spread some dim light and we watched our surroundings carefully, heart beating fast in combat mode.\n'Rafe,' Tashee whispered. 'you know?'\n'First time for me.' I whispered back.\nA second roar sounded more distant.\n'I'll take watch.' I said.\n'No.' Tashee said. 'Rest important for you. I'll watch, not much night left anyway.'\n'Sure?' I asked, glancing at her, her eyes fully alert and shining in the dim light.\n'Sure.' she said and I knew she was."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Writing Prompt: In this erotic science fiction story, explore the intense attraction and forbidden romance that develops between Rafe, the human soldier stranded on the island, and Tashee, the Silth warrior who he saved.

We were so far into our allotted time, and I'd hardly started my essay. But I just couldn't think about the damned essay with Professor Buchanon sitting just a few feet away from me.\nHis stripes shown through his button-up shirt. He nudged his glasses up on his snout. Memories of our last time together flooded my mind. In the middle of my daydream, however, he looked up from his work and shot me a menacing glare, creating a pinch of heat inside me.\nMy eyes widened and darted back down to my paper. My heart was pounding. I got back to writing. I knew it was too late now to finish my essay, so I bided my time to ask him that sweet question once again.\nSure enough, the alarm on his desk rang before I could even finish the first page. \"Pencils down.\" My classmates stood to turn in their essays.\nI held my paper up to my chest, hiding it from my classmate's prying eyes, and took my sweet time to step up to his desk. He pretended not to pay attention to me until I'd arrived.\n\"Um... Professor Buchanon.\" He looked up to me and removed his glasses.\n\"Yes, Miss Lily?\" His tone was so cold. It sent a shiver down my spine.\nI couldn't help but smirk a bit as I laid my essay in front of him. \"Well you see, Professor, I just couldn't finish my essay in time. Is there anything I could do to make it up? Anything at all?\" I rested my hands on his desk, flouncing my cleavage a foot his face.\nHe glanced at my tits, then back up to my face with nary a single hint of expression. I saw the way his eyes lingered though, and it got me so hot.\nHe let out a long sigh, and stood up, setting his pen down. My heart skipped a beat. I could see the outline between his legs. My mouth watered. \"Anything, huh, Miss Lily? What am I going to do with you?\" He said simply as he shut the door to the classroom.\n\"Anything you want, Mark.\" I couldn't wait any longer. I began to unbutton my shirt. He was closing the blinds, but glanced at me a few times as he did.\n\"Oh, you naughty kitty,\" he scolded. \"That's Professor Buchanon.\" He loosened his tie as he approached me. The thick fur of his chest escaped his collar. I gulped as we finally touched.\nHe picked me up and set me down on his desk. He continued unbuttoning my shirt as his teeth grazed my neck in a kiss. The electricity between us was palpable.\nI worked my way down his buttons myself, and felt his hard-cut abs on my way down to his belt, which I snaked out of its loops.\nBefore I could toss it to the side, he took it from my hands, and slithered it around my neck. My tail twitched and my breath hitched. \"There we are. A collar for my naughty kitten.\"\n\"Profess- or- Buchanon,\" I choked out. He flipped me onto my stomach and lifted my skirt.\n\"That's right, my little slut,\" he whispered, tugging on the belt. He unzipped his pants. \"Say my name, you naughty kitten.\"\n\"Professor-\" I gasped when he released the tightness on my neck for a second. \"Buchanon-\"\nHe slapped my ass. I whimpered, but began to purr. I looked over my shoulder at his devious smirk. My eyes fell upon his cock, thick, long, and ready. I wanted him to make my insides ache. But he made me wait.\nHe spit on his paw and rubbed me through my panties. \"Why, my little kitten, you're already soaking wet.\" His low purr sounded more like a growl. He tore my panties off with his a single claw.\nI felt the air on my exposed skin and bit my lip. I longed for his cock so bad. He snaked two fingers inside. I gasped, but he only pulled the belt tighter around my neck.\nHe curled his fingers and began to slide them in and out of me rhythmically. I leaned into the collar he'd placed on me. My vision began to darken, stars dotting the room. My pussy felt like pure bliss. He loosened his grip on my leash again and I gasped a breath in.\nBlood rushing to my head pushed me to the edge of climax. \"Oh, Mark,\" I moaned, grinding into his hand. As I felt it approach, however, he slipped his fingers back out.\n\"Easy, now, not yet, kitten. And you aren't to call me Mark,\" he scolded me. I pouted. He maneuvered me with ease back off of the desk, and ordered me to kneel. I was shocked at how much more rough he was being than last time.\n\"I said kneel.\" He grabbed a fistful of my hair and lowered me to the ground. I let him, but stared up at him, confused and scared. It felt shameful that this was the most turned on I'd been in my life. \"Open.\" I opened my mouth wide, turning my attention to his huge cock.\nWith one push, he shoved himself down my throat. I gagged and flinched, but he held my collar with one hand and my hair with the other. Tears were in my eyes.\n\"That's right, baby, take it all in,\" he groaned, shoving himself further slowly. I couldn't believe there was still more. I placed my hands on his thighs and tried to push away, but he held me steadfast. \"Now, kitten, behave.\" He yanked on my collar, and I stopped resisting. Tears were streaming down my face now. He pleasured himself with my mouth, moaning as he did so. Just as I felt as if I were on the verge of blacking out, he came in my mouth.\n\"Swallow,\" he commanded. And I did.\nHe pulled his cock from my mouth and let go of me and my leash. I fell onto my side on the cold tile floor, coughing and gasping for breath. He towered over me. The harsh fluorescent lights shone off his fur. He looked statuesque: a god. And I wanted nothing more than for him to ravish me with all he had.\nHe swooped me up again and leaned me against his desk, facing away from him. Here it comes, I thought, suspense pulsing through me.\nHe lifted my skirt again. One of his strong paws took my leash in hand once again, while the other stroked his cock a few times. He tapped me, toyed with my clit, and rubbed my entrance with his cock.\nThen, all at once, he slammed himself into me with a yank on my leash. I let out a pained moan, which caused a strong tiger paw to cover my mouth before I could give us away.\n\"You be good now, kitten,\" he warned, perfectly still inside me. I nodded, tears in my eyes. His girth was pushing my limits. It seemed to fill every inch of me. Then came the thrusting.\nWhat started as pain dulled as his body moved in time- in, out, in, out. Forceful yet precise, he violated me. The collar tightened. Stars filled my tear-clouded vision, and the world disappeared into sheer ecstasy. In, out, in out.\nHe pounded me, shaking the desk. He smacked my ass and I emitted the faintest whimper. Everything hurt, but everything felt like the best thing I'd ever had. He snaked an arm around my waist and played with my breast, leaning in and breathing hot on my neck. I shivered.\nHe picked up the pace, and I could feel it coming. The rhythm of his powerful cock was bringing me closer and closer to bliss. \"Mr. -Buchanon-,\" I choked out. \"I'm gonna cum.\"\n\"Me too,\" he breathed out.\nWait, what?\nIt was too late. Mr. Buchanon let out a low moan. My pussy felt even hotter and wetter than it had been moments before. He pulled out slowly. I yelped in pain just before I myself was brought to orgasm. Shockwaves ripped through my pussy, sheer bliss, sheer happiness. My body felt warm.\nHe rubbed my clit until my pussy stopped twitching. My face was pressed against his desk, my tongue hanging out, until the orgasm passed.\nI snapped back to reality. \"Professor,\" I stood, shocked at his disregard for what I'd told him last time we'd been together. \"You have to buy me the morning after pill.\"\n\"Miss Lily,\" he addressed me with a calm, unforgiving callousness. \"I'm afraid,\" he yanked me closer to him, holding me against his bare body, \"that you promised me anything.\""}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Writing Prompt: Explore the forbidden desires between a student and her strict professor as they engage in a steamy encounter after class.

She never should have let Lina convince her to check out the new club on the East side of town. Going out with her was ALWAYS a mistake. Evie knew this and yet she went because she knew it would be a mistake.\nJust like dating Alan had been.\nUgh.\nThinking about that was worse than the hangover.\nWith another groan, waking almost upon her, Evie instead focused on recalling last night. That at least would give her an idea about how bad the headache was going to be. Which was way more productive than thinking about... Ugh.\n _The bar was called The Lunar Eclipse. Dark as night inside, per usual, but with the exception of one large, luminous light above the dance floor that, she supposed, represented the moon. The floor itself was alight with a soft golden glow for the sun and the dancing bodies, she guessed again, were the earth between them. It was a little literal for her taste but it did have a nice effect. Small lights (stars?) randomly placed on the walls marked the edges of the bar's universe and provided guiding light to the drunkards needing a piss._\n _Lina, extra as always, was wearing a red, skin tight party dress that perfectly complimented her hispanic complexion and full figure. Her thick black hair bloomed out of her head and down to her waist in tight ringlets, providing her with her own backdrop so the red stood out even more. Gold hoops in her ears and her wrists, striking makeup and a pair of 5 inch leopard print heels (she needed them at 5 feet tall) completed the ensemble and screamed the only thing that Lina wanted anyone to think when they saw her: I'm way sexier than you._\n _Not that Evie would disagree with the assessment. At 5'2 she didn't stand much taller than her old college roommate, but of the two of them, people's eye always found Lina first. Her own hair was a deep reddish brown that waved when she let it grow beyond her shoulders. With it sitting just below her chin, her hair retained loose curls and that night she had left it in its natural state of mess. Wings accented her hazel eyes that were slightly angled due to her mother's filipino heritage and a light smattering of freckles reflected her caucasian father's._\n _She'd chosen a short floral dress that hugged and pushed up her A cup breasts and flared a little to give her slender frame the illusion of hips. Evie was not curvy, but she was proportionate with just enough shape to not be mistaken for a 12 year old boy._\n _Her own look was finished with large diamond earrings and comfortable 2 \u00bd inch black strappy heels._\n _After checking in their jackets, they waded into the mass of bodies on the dance floor to make their way to the bar where Evie wedged herself between two couples and ordered their usual first round of drinks of the night. Grabbing the Long Islands, they lucked out and found a small table to stand at and chat._\n _\"I'm so happy you came out tonight!\" Lina yelled over the din of the club._\n _Evie eyed her as she took a long sip from her tea, \"You're making it sound like I was planning on holing myself in my apartment.\" She couldn't deny she'd thought about it, but Lina didn't know that._\n _Her friend waved the statement away. \"You're not the type to mope but you and Alan were a thing for years. It's tough to let that go.\"_\n _Evie shrugged. \"It is tough. I just can't believe we spent all that time together just for him to decide he was never going to commit.\" Another sip. \"All of senior year we talked about getting engaged and maybe having kids one day... I keep telling myself to be glad he figured it out now instead of after we got married.\"_\n _Lina nodded sympathetically then downed the rest of her drink in a few long pulls from her straws. \"Well, you handled it way better than I would have and I'm proud of you. The most efficient way to get over a break up is to do things. Whether that's talking, going out or doing new people.\" She winked excessively to emphasize her point and Evie laughed, downing her own drink in turn._\n _\"You're the psychology major, so I'll take your word for it.\"_\n _The next couple of hours went to a few more rounds of drinks and dancing with each other, and various strangers, under the false moon. The dj did a good job of managing the flow of the music and the drinks drowned any of Evie's thoughts on the break up._\n _It had been two weeks. It was time to move on._\n _As she burst out in laughter watching Lina dominate some poor guy with her hip shaking, she caught the eye of a man a few feet away by the bar. His blonde hair shone in the pale moon-like light from above and his features were handsome in the golden light from below. He was at least 6 feet tall, with wide shoulders sheathed in a white collared shirt beneath a blazer of an indiscernible color in the lighting._\n _There was something magnetic about him and, for a brief moment, she thought his dark eyes flashed as they met hers. It was a strange moment, one of those where the music seemed muted and she lost awareness of the bodies gyrating around her._\n _And then it was gone._\n _She turned away as someone, it turned out to be Lina, took her arm and pulled her back into the fray. Her friend shouted into her ear after a moment._\n _\"That asshole tried drag me off the dance floor!\"_\n _Evie gave her a startled look, her initial thought was of the man by the bar but then she realized that Lina meant the guy she'd been dancing with. Her face turned apologetic._\n _\"Sorry, I should have been paying attention so I could help you.\"_\n _Lina waved the apology away, \"I can handle myself. I'm just not drunk enough yet to leave!\" She giggled and took Evie's hands to twirl her around. \"Let's get more drinks!,\" she cried and then pulled Evie toward the bar, parting the crowd like Moses did the Red Sea._\n _When they reached it, Evie looked around for the blonde guy but he was nowhere to be seen. It was disappointing but it was obvious it wasn't meant to be and the alcohol in her next drink allowed her to forget him soon enough._\n _She was back on the dance floor again. Things were getting a little hazy in her memory, but she remembered that Lina was next to her and it was very late. And then the next thing she remembered was him._\n _The handsome god with the halo. Or was it just his blonde hair?_\n _Smooth like butter, he took Evie's hand and pulled her close and they danced. His body was muscular and heat seemed to emanate from him. He was so tall and something about him sent a shiver up her spine as his hands roamed her body through her dress as she pressed it against him. His eyes were golden..._\nEvie opened her eyes.\nWhat had happened next? She groaned a third time and looked down at herself.\nShe wasn't naked which was a good sign.\nBut she also wasn't in her own clothes. Bad sign.\nThis also wasn't her bed. Very bad sign.\nWhich meant this wasn't her apartment. That was just bad.\nThe room around her was rustic in style with splashes of blues and red amongst the wood furniture. The bed was huge, an abundance of pillows and a thick comforter had her practically trapped in a plush prison. No wonder she'd struggled to wake up, she'd been sleeping in a damn cloud.\nThen the headache hit her.\nWhat protection drowsiness and then shock had given her could only hold the hangover at bay for so long and she almost willingly sunk back into the folds, if only to avoid dealing with it. But she was in a strange place wearing a man's rather large t shirt and this was no time to succumb to her sloth.\nEvie crawled carefully to the edge of the bed where light pierced her brain and threatened to kill her, at least that's how it felt. The room was L shaped and the wall had blocked the large window, and the light streaming through it, from where she'd been laying. She squinted through the pain, the headache was coming full force, and let out one long, seething, \"Fuck.\"\nThis was not how last night was supposed to go.\nSlipping off the bed, her hand up to shield her eyes from the death rays, she approached the window and was surprised to find it barred.\n\"Who the fuck bars their windows?\" she murmured to herself.\nPsychos. That's who.\n _Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck._\nShe'd done a good job of holding down the feeling of dread that had been slowly gathering in her belly. This wasn't the first time she'd woken up in someone's bed, though the last time was before she'd started dating Alan. What she wasn't familiar with was not remembering anything. That was the thought that had woken her up and what was now sending chills down her spine. She didn't know where she was. What she did. Who she did it with. Nothing.\n _Was I drugged?_\nThat terrified her further.\nTurning from the window, she rushed to the nearest set of doors and opened one. Inside, she found a huge bathroom. It was pristine with a large tub on one end and a stand up shower in the other corner. The sudden urge to throw up came upon her and she dove for the toilet, emptying her stomach into the bowl as she fought the panic threatening to drown her.\nAfter a few dry heaves to ensure there was nothing left, Evie flushed the toilet, sat on the cold tile and attempted to gather herself.\nShe needed to calm down. Her father had been a military man, between that and frequent camping and multiple day hiking trips growing up, he'd raised her to be sensible in tough situations.\nLong inhale. Long exhale. Repeat.\nHer heart rate lowered after a few moments and she picked herself off of the floor and approached the sink where she took a look at herself in the mirror. With the exception of her makeup running a bit from sleeping in it, her face was unmarred. She then checked under the shirt; her bra and panties were still on, and she found no proof of struggle or love making on her body, arms or legs. Finally, she gingerly slid her panties to the side to check her womanhood.\nNothing out of the ordinary. No soreness, no foreign liquids, funny smells or raw patches. Wonderful nothing.\nEvie sighed in relief. But she knew she wasn't out of the fire yet. She wet her face and rubbed her makeup off as best she could, then dried off on a towel hanging nearby.\nExiting the bathroom, she passed another set of doors and, peaking in, found an enormous closet half filled with mens clothing. She left those alone, approaching the last set that could only be the exit and, pausing momentarily to listen for any noises on the other side, she pulled on the handle.\nIt turned but she couldn't pull the door open. Something was locking it in place.\nShe pulled harder, heedless of the noise as the dread started to rise again, and quickly switched to banging on the door. \"Hey! Let me the hell out of here! HEY!\"\nOnly silence answered her and she turned to start searching the room for...anything. She looked for her phone or her small purse that she'd had with her, though if they'd taken her clothes she didn't have much hope of finding them. She then went to the window, wincing again at the sunlight, and looked through the bars to see if she could recognize where she was.\nWoods.\nThe sunlight beaming into the window was shining through an open patch in the foliage above. Morning mist blanketed the floor, and birds were chirping merrily. It reminded her briefly of hiking through the Appalachians as a teenager.\nThe beauty of it distracted her for only a moment as the sound of a door opening caught her attention. She wanted to freeze but forced herself to turn and confront her kidnapper, twisting her face into a frown to hide her fear.\nThe god stood in the doorway. His eyes were not golden like she remembered, they were dark, almost black from a distance and his hair was indeed blonde, though darker streaks beneath gave it more depth. His shoulders strained the black t shirt he wore, his arms corded with muscle and his skin was bronzed from the sun.\nShe didn't do a bad job nicknaming him, that was for sure.\nHis jaw was hidden beneath a well kept beard and she judged him to be in his 30s, though it was hard to place where.\n\"Finished with your assessment?\" Evie blinked at the question, registering that she had been giving him a hard stare for the last several seconds. His voice was not unpleasant.\n _Not the kind of thing that should matter right now, Evie!_ , she chided herself.\n\"I'm finished with being here. Let me go.\" Her voice didn't waver so she counted that as a win.\nHe raised a brow at her, his demeanor utterly relaxed. \"You don't want something to eat?\" He reached next to him and brought out a tray covered in breakfast food. The smell of bacon quickly filled the room and her traitorous stomach growled in response.\n\"No, I'm only hungry because I just puked everything up after realizing I've been kidnapped. I don't want anything from you except that you let me leave.\"\nThe god shrugged, \"Well, I'm hungry.\" He stepped into the room and closed the door behind him. She listened for a click to indicate that it was being locked but heard nothing. Maybe she could...\nHe approached her and she tensed up involuntarily. The flicker of amusement in his eyes disturbed her as he stopped and sat down on the couch perpendicular to the window and placed the tray on the coffee table before him. Putting an egg and a couple of strips of bacon on a slice of toast, he began to eat, closing his eyes in appreciation. Evie's stomach growled again in consternation, which she pointedly ignored, as her eyes flitted between the god and the door, judging whether she had enough room to get around him and escape.\n\"You can't outrun me so you might as well eat something.\"\nShe had just started leaning onto the balls of her feet to make a dash for it when his sudden comment made her jerk to a pause.\nHis eyes were still closed! _How the hell did he know I was about to make a run for it?_\nAfter debating for a moment, she quietly went and sat on the couch across from him and, watching him closely, reached out to the tray to grab a slice of bacon. When he didn't move, she picked it up and began chewing on it.\nHe opened his eyes then, gazing at her beneath thick, dark blonde eyebrows. \"That's better,\" he said in a satisfactory manner. They ate in silence; him savoring it slowly, while she ate as quickly and as quietly as she could. The last thing she grabbed was egg, bacon and toast like he'd eaten earlier. She took a small bite of it then placed it on the edge of the table and took a swig of water to wash it down before suddenly flipping the food into his face and leaping toward the door.\nPumping her legs as fast as she could, Evie managed to make it almost to the door when she was, quite literally, plucked off of her feet with a startled yell and thrown, quite unceremoniously, onto the bed.\nShe hit the mound of pillows, quickly sinking beneath it and flailed in an attempt to get free.\nBut before she could get her bearings, she felt the bed shift under his weight as he approached and kicked her foot blindly, trying to catch him off guard.\nHe chuckled at her feeble attempt and caught her foot easily, using it to pull her to him. With another cry, she slid out from among the bedding, clutching the bottom of the shirt to keep it from riding up too high.\n\"Let me go!!\" His response was to continue to pull her to him until her right thigh rested on his left hip, then he reached down, ignoring her struggles, and lifted her so that she was sitting in his lap, pressed against his chest.\n\"No, I'm afraid I can't do that.\"\nEvie looked up at him, panting from exertion and fear, \"What do you want from me? Why am I here!?\"\nIn spite of her predicament, she was acutely aware of his hard body against hers, of how big he was compared to her. That magnetism that she recalled when her eyes met his the first time was back as she gazed into them now.\nThere was definitely gold coming from the dark depths and it made her heart skip a beat.\n\"Because you are meant to be mine,\" his voice was deep and she felt the vibration of it through her entire being, a sense of _something_ when he said it.\nAnd then his mouth was on hers. She recoiled in shock, her lips parting for a gasp that he took advantage of, his tongue entering her mouth and dancing with hers expertly, drawing her into the kiss even as she fought to stop him, her mind racing.\nHe was ridiculously strong. His arms held her firmly against him, pinning hers between them and forcing her to keep her legs on either side of his waist where he sat. One hand travelled up to tangle itself in her short hair before he ceased kissing her, leaving her gasping for air, and tilted her head back just enough to expose her throat.\nThere, he buried his face in her neck and took a long, deep breath as if inhaling her scent.\n\"No!,\" was all she could manage.\nHe made a deep throaty sound. It sent tingles down her spine that settled in her sex, which was being ground against his due to their close proximity. The unwanted feeling snapped her out of her bewilderment at the sensory onslaught and she jerked to get him away from her neck.\nWhen he looked up at her, his eyes a deep amber, she slammed her forehead into his nose.\nHer father had taught her the move and it was enough to make him let her go as he reached up to stymy the blood spurting from his face.\nEvie would have made some kind of triumphant noise if the headutt hadn't resounded in her already aching cranium, making her incredibly nauseous, but she did manage to throw herself off the bed and away from him. With the grace of a fish out of water, she landed painfully on the wooden floor and attempted to scramble towards the light which indicated the direction the door was in.\nDark spots flooded Evie's vision and her head swam as she made her escape, but she continued at as fast of a half crawl as she could manage.\nHitting the sunlight set her brain on fire and the world tilted as the nausea hit her again. This time, however, she couldn't keep herself steady and she fell to her side, slamming into the ground, hitting her head and promptly blacking out.\n\nHe hadn't expected her to headbutt him. Though it hurt like hell, he was thoroughly impressed as he shifted his nose back into place before it healed. The blood had already stopped flowing after the initial spurt but it had made a hell of a mess on the sheets.\nGetting up just as she started to scramble away, he was about to grab her when she suddenly veered off course and, slamming into the wall not far from her destination, knocked herself out.\nIt almost made him laugh.\nIt probably would have if he wasn't aware that his bone was much more solid than a human's and that her stunt probably caused her a mild concussion on top of whatever hangover she had from last night.\nWalking over, he gingerly picked up his future mate, admitting to himself that he was still somewhat shocked at the change of events in the last 24 hours. The Pack wasn't going to handle this well.  \nLooking at the slight creature in his arms, he wasn't sure if she would either. But considering the intelligence she'd shown in the last several minutes, he also couldn't doubt that his instinct knew something he didn't.\nNonetheless, she was here and she would be his.

He shifted once more through the tiring flood of emails and spreadsheets as he had done for the last week. He had sunk too many hours into another project, making sure Ghopper Enterprises had received their shipment of data processor chips on time.\nBeing a commodities broker was not an easy job in this day and age. He reconfirmed the calendar date at the bottom of the screen, June 11th, 2260. With no delays the shipment should meet its destination within the week.\nJon combed his hands through his short brown hair. He could finally get a break. Exiting out of work related windows, he paused as he came upon the familiar page that had remained open since yesterday. The title flashed wildly in a rainbow of colors. \"Anime-co's bio-droids, hyperrealistic and programmed for you pleasure.\"\nBelow were dozens of photos. They were indistinguishable from humans, and many were modeled after women from classic animes and mangas. It was as if they had popped off their respective medium and joined the real world. Their detail was stunning.\nSome were shown to be doing housework, while others took on the role of nannies, and construction assistants. A tiny synthetic girl displayed her incredible strength in lifting an enormous steel beam.\nTucked away further down the page were more suggestive photos and videos. Jon sighed as he clicked on one of a playful girl who exactly resembled Super Sonico from the series of the same name. Her pink hair flowed over her shoulders, and strummed a mighty rift on her guitar. \"Hello, my name is Sonico.\" She was excited, but characteristically soft-spoken. \"I love to play music and make people happy!\"\nNext to the video was a highlighted link, that said 'see pricing.' Clicking it, another list popped up, and showed purchasing options along with reviews.\nThe very first choice was what he sought. Two beautiful anime girls embraced in the photo. Yoko Littner from Gurren Lagann squeezed Sonico tight against her cheek. She was in her signature clothing, with delicious ample breasts squeezed together behind a flaming bikini top. Her red hair was intertwined and partially hidden by Sonico's own.\nCaptioned beneath it read 'For a limited time buy this set for only 15,000, credit card information required.'\nJon arose from the chair and looked around the study, leaving the computer frozen on the pair. Money had never been an issue, as his grand five-bedroom estate could testify. He ran his hand over his smooth, handsome face and sighed once more. He wanted companionship, but he was only used to talking with people from behind a screen.\nHe walked to the kitchen; ignoring the noticeable bulge in his pants. From the fridge he retrieved a plate of leftover sushi, and took the meal out on the veranda.\nThe landscape of rural Montana was something to be admired. It was from this isolated locale that Jon could concentrate on his work. It was his own island, separated from the prying eyes of the real world. The shrubbery was green year-round, and the crystalline sky that stretched beyond the tall noble pines lent a profound sense of being to anyone who witnessed it.\nHe ate the sushi cold, with his fingers. His ex-wife had helped to make him a recluse. After her betrayal in trying to embezzle money from him, he had grown cautious to let anyone back in. She had been a long and arduous chapter in his life, that he did not want to repeat.\nHe had survived her and build himself anew. The fruits of his labor were present in his manor, and its many flourishes. But what was the point if there was on one to share it with?\nJon leaned on the railing and watched the sun dip lower into the horizon. The cascade of orange convinced him. He needed to overcome his mistrust, he needed heralds to keep him from drowning in his own insecurity. A chill dashed up his spine as the northern air signaled night.\nFinishing the roll, he continued back inside and returned to his study. Yoko and Sonico kept smiling, enthralled by the fact of simply being alive.\nWith a steady hand he coerced the cursor over to the 'Order' button.\n\nJon woke with a start as the doorbell echoed in his ears. He was unused to hearing it, and briefly panicked at the sound. \"Uh, just one minute!\" he threw on some pants, and took the spiraling staircase two steps at a time.\nAnother chime rang, and he skidded across the tiled foyer to the entrance.\n\"H-hello? Can I help you?\" he opened the door to a blue-suited deliveryman.\n\"Yes. Mr. Erickson? I've got two big packages that I need you to sign off on.\"\nJon immediately turned red as he saw the unmistakable Anime-co labeling on two sizable crates behind him. Had they really shipped so quickly?\n\"Of course.\" He snatched up the stylus and scratched his signature into the pad.\n\"Thank you. Do you need help getting these inside or...?\" the middle-aged man stroked his beard.\n\"No, no, I've got it, thanks!\"\nA wave of relief washed over him as the deliveryman's truck vanished behind the tree-line. Summoning the strength in his muscular arms he hauled the crates into the high-ceilinged living room.\nWith some effort he finally pried off the front face of one. Laying within, Yoko Littner slept peacefully in a bed of styrofoam. She was perfect, resting wonderfully in her original outfit. Her rubber short-shorts left little to the imagination, and her white studded belt complimented her polished flaming boots. Her breasts were magnificent pillows held tight under fiery underwire.\nHer lava hair had become unruly in the journey, and the two characteristic chopsticks had fallen from her head, only to be found on her shoulder.\nJon gulped and gathered his courage. It had been sometime since he had been in female company. \"How do I...turn you on?\" he said to himself and looked around her mouth-watering anatomy for instruction.\nHer bosom was so inviting, her rack a generous set of double d's. Her flesh so supple, that he could see the tiny delicate pores that comprised it. Without thinking he pressed his full countenance between them and felt the sweet touch of her skin against his.\n\"You're so...warm.\" Jon closed his eyes and rubbed into her.\n\"Thank you.\" he looked up to see Yoko giving a small smile. \"I'm insulated, so I stay a nice 98 degrees just like you.\" He felt her gloved arm trickle down his back and squeeze his butt playfully.\n\"You're awake! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...invade your personal space.\" He reeled back and stiffened.\nYoko chuckled and stepped out of the container. \"You don't like my breasts? You were cuddling with them awfully hard.\" She pressed them together with her elbows and swayed.\n\"No, I do! You just caught me off guard. I thought you were offline.\"\n\"I get turned on when my sensors pick up a significant heat signature. Are you sweating?\"\n\"A little. You get turned on you say?\"\n\"Yeah, in more ways than one.\" She wiggled her eyebrows.\nYoko paused and looked around the regal living room. Large sofas sat across from a massive flatscreen television. Though it was mostly minimalist, the furniture that was present was high-end and purposeful. The glass coffee table glinted off the chandelier's fixtures and reflected back onto its own copper legs.\n\"Wow, this place is beautiful, do you live here? What's your name?\" she gathered the chopsticks and slowly attended to fixing her mane.\n\"M-My name is Jon Erickson, this is my home.\"\n\"Can I live here too?\"\n\"If you want to.\"\n\"Awesome!\" Yoko embraced him again, and ran her hands through his crewcut. \"I'm so lucky! Jon?\"\n\"Yes?\"\n\"Can I call you Master?\"\n\"No, you don't need to do that.\" He looked around nervously.\n\"I want to though, you bought me. It's only right.\"\n\"I, uh....\"\n\"Oh, cool!\" she eyed the still sealed crate beside her. \"You got us as a set!\" she knocked furiously on the side. \"Hello? Calling Suuuuper Sonico, wake up in there!\"\n\"I'll get her out, just let me find that crowbar.\"\nIn one swift movement Yoko tore the crate's front off and let it clatter to the floor. \"No worries, I'm really strong.\"\nSonico was just as precious as promised. Her luscious layers of pink hair were stretched taut over size D breasts that were barely contained in her white and blue hoodie. Across the front in rainbow lettering the words 'Nitroplus' was spelled out. Her enormous chrome headphones cradled her head in place. By her side rested a beautiful stratocaster.\nJon cocked his head and felt himself growing lighter.\n\"Sonico! Sonico? Come on wake up!\" Yoko pressed her body into her and continued to repeat the mantra as she poked a single finger into her cleavage.\nSonico's eyelids fluttered, and she mewed quietly.\n\"Looks like she needs a little more prompting. Would you like to help me, Master?\"\nYoko yanked him into the box and held tight onto him. \"She's being silly. She won't wake up unless she gets kisses.\"\nShe began to plant her lips on Sonico's neck over and over, while her yellow eyes glowed with delight. Jon followed suit, and delivered a single kiss to her cheek.\nFeigning a yawn, Sonico snapped her eyes open and flung her arms around him. \"It's so nice to finally meet you. I need some inspiration in my life!\"\n\"His name is Jon. He's our new Master, just look at this house!\"\n\"Oh, my. It goes on forever. Do you have a big bathtub too?\"\n\"I have three.\"\nSonico hopped up and down, \"Let's go take a bath together! You look all sweaty, you need to relax.\" She whipped her shirt over her head and worked her skirt down to her ankles. \"I love baths.\"\n\"W-why don't I show you around a bit first? You deserve a proper tour and, uh,...wow.\" Jon stared at the shameless, well-endowed girl in front of him. Her nude, smooth features were enough to stupefy any man.\n\"Well, okay. Do I have to put my clothes back on though? It's easier to just leave them off.\"\n\"She'll look for any excuse to stay naked.\" Yoko rolled her eyes. \"Why don't you show him some of your outfits?\"\n\"Oh, that's a great idea. We can model for him.\" Sonico presented her adorable butt, and bent over to retrieve more garments from the crate. \"I like...this one!\"\nShe pulled out a familiar bikini and knocked her hips in contemplation. \"Don't you have other outfits too, Yoko?\"\n\"I do!\" she turned and looked through more clothing. Among the articles, Jon noticed a stewardess outfit, and many star themed accessories. \"I think I just want to wear this and nothing else.\" Yoko produced an enormous replica sniper rifle, and winked.\nJon was wide-eyed at the thought, and found himself short of breath. Reading his body language Yoko collected herself, and coerced Sonico back into her original outfit, despite her pouting.\n\"We're ready to take the tour, Master.\"\n\"Right. Just follow me.\" Jon gathered saliva into his dry throat. They really were there for him. Not merely as pleasure droids, but the very epitome of their respective character was ever-present in their personalities. His dream women were in his house, well-meaning, and relentlessly beautiful. He could broker a deal between two companies worth millions without hesitation, but this was a different challenge altogether.\nTowards the back of the house he pointed out the vast indoor gym, with computerized treadmills, weights, and punching bags. \"This is my workout space, feel free to use it or train, no target practice though, please.\"\n\"You must work out a lot, this place is a mess.\" Yoko said, matter-of-factly.\"\n\"Sorry, about clutter.\" Jon picked a sweaty rag and tossed it in the hamper.\n\"He sure does, just feel these abs.\" Sonico pet his mid-section.\n\"Thank you....\" He retreated and quickly showed them the attached sauna. Complete with steaming stones and towels. The wooden benches within were snug, but comfortable.\n\"Fuck yes.\" Yoko's smile grew wider with each new room.\n\"Upstairs we have the bedrooms.\" Every chamber offered a kingsized bed, with large windows and larger closets. Each coming with a wall television, and opulent carpet space whose touch rivaled that of the silken sheets laid down. \"I have four guest-rooms, so you two can make yourself at home in whichever you like.\"\nThe girls simply looked at each other and giggled.\n\"What's so funny?\"\n\"We were thinking we'd just sleep with you if that's okay.\"\n\"Oh, of course. I mean, if you want to.\" Jon felt his flush return.\n\"Moving on.\"\n\nSonico traced her finger along the edge of the slick porcelain surface. The bathtub, much like all else in the estate was of grandiose design; big enough to hold a foursome, with decorative faucets, and tempting jets along its inner walls. In the corner of the room, a curtainless shower stood. It was laid out like a bathhouse, and multiple drains ensured one could travel between them without incident. The far wall played host to the bidet and the toilet, making sure that cleanliness was a priority.\n\"This is the bathroom, where you can wash yourselves, and bathe regularly. I'd like you to keep tidy if you can. There are heated towels by the tub if you need them.\"\nSonico was entranced by every fiberglass fixture. Why would anyone want to leave such a wonderful room? She envisioned lounging in sudsy splendor with her handsome new owner. \"Do you have bubbles?\"\n\"I don't think so.\"\n\"How can you take a bath without bubbles? You should get some!\"\n\"I'll make sure to do that.\"\n\"Come on, stop drooling.\" Yoko pulled her through the doorframe, we got more to see.\"\n\n\"This is the kitchen. I don't know if you guys eat, but...\"\nYoko clambered onto the center island countertop, and dug into a basket of fruit, pulling out a banana of noticeable girth. \"Hey, Sonico look what I found!\"\n\"Oh, I love bananas they are so sweet and delicious.\" Stealing it from Yoko's hand she peeled it and began nibbling on the tip.\n\"We don't have to eat.\" Yoko said opening the fridge, \"but we certainly enjoy tasting things.\"\n\"I can see that.\" Jon gawked as Sonico suckled deeply on the yellow shaft with her eyes closed in concentration.\n\"You've got quite the selection here. Does someone else live here? This is a lot of food for a single guy....\" Yoko plucked a strawberry from the bowl and ran it over her lips.\n\"Yeah, well, I go through a lot of calories.\" He looked to the floor.\n\"We might need to stock up then. Maybe some whipped cream, chocolate, and other good stuff. I could go for a big, juicy sausage myself.\" She played with black strap of her top thoughtfully.\n\"Uh, sure, we can do that. I still need to show you the pool first.\"\n\"Pool?\" Sonico looked up from the gooey nub that remained. On her face several strings of mush were present.\n\"You have something on your face, silly. Don't worry...I'll get it off.\" Yoko pulled her close and delicately ran her tongue from her chin to her temple. \"Mmm, that is a good banana.\"\n\"Thank you.\" She rubbed the saliva into her cheek.\nJon blinked and tried to clear his head before opening the curtains to the large bay windows behind them.\n\"Is that it? It's like you have an ocean in your backyard!\" Sonico discarded the peel and pressed her face to the glass.\nThe pool was a pristine blue that sparkled under the morning sun. Stretching nearly the width of the building, its fanciful tiled perimeter lead to inviting marble steps. The water beckoned with a virginal clarity. Nearby, hidden among the privacy of rosebushes, a hot tub sat at the base of a sculpted rock waterfall. The tanning deck adjacent featured a dozen unused reclining chairs.\n\"Can I swim? Please?\" Sonico begged.\n\"Sure. Do you want me to go get your swimsuit? I think I saw one among your outfits....\"\nWith her clothes already forgotten on the floor, Sonico opened the door and skipped playfully outside, her pale butt jiggling all the way to the edge of the water. Without a second thought, she leapt in and splashed about. \"I love you, Master!\" she called out, her hair already clinging to her body in a soaked mass.\n\"She didn't even take off her headphones.\"\n\"It's okay, they're waterproof, like us.\"\nYoko smirked and mashed her breasts into Jon's shoulder blades. From behind he felt her hot breath on the nape of his neck. \"Little nudist can't help herself. We really do love you, you know.\" She pawed confidently at the hem of his pants. \"Thank you for welcoming us into your life. Why don't we get these things off, huh?\"\n\"M-maybe a little later. This is all happening really fast.\" He slipped from her tenacious grip. \"Let's get to know each other a little better first. You have free rein of the house, do whatever you like.\"\n\"You are a romantic. We just want you to be happy, but I have to tell you,\" she whispered in his ear, \"I really want to be fucked.\"\n\"R-right. Well, I need to finish up another project, those stocks don't sell themselves. Please excuse me.\"\nWith long strides he disappeared into the house.\n\"What happened? Where is he going?\" Sonico rested her tits on the side of the pool.\n\"Master needs some time to himself right now. I don't think he's used to company like us.\"\n\"Aww, I hope he's alright. Everyone deserves to have fun.\"\n\"He'll be alright. He just needs a little encouragement. We need to show that we're here for him.\"\nSonico hauled herself out, and laid her sopping, buxom body upon the cool- deck. Beads of liquid raced over her nipples and rolled down her smooth pubis. \"I gotcha. I'll give his cock a rock opera to remember me by.\""}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Writing Prompt: In this futuristic world, Jon has just received two hyperrealistic bio-droids from Anime-co.
